            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi, I'm Brianna Pappas. I am currently a UNH Coding Bootcamp student working
                toward starting a new career! I graduated from Roger Williams University in 2012
                with a Bachelor of Arts in Communications. The majority of my time since graduating
                from college has been spent at Connection. I started in Order Compliance and worked
                my way up to Associate Contracts Specialist and now Contracts Specialist. While 
                working at Connection, I started taking Masters classes at Southern New Hampshire University
                working towards my MBA, but soon realized that it wasn't what I was interested in.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I have always had an interest in coding. I was interested in the creative side and 
                how Programmers always seem to be working on a new and exciting project. In just the short 
                time I have been learning to code, it has made me a better problem solver, 
                has taught me patience and definitely pushes me outside of my comfort zone.
                I can't wait to learn more!
            </p>
